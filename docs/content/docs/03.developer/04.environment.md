## Docker Compose Environment

::

For convenience, a Docker Compose environment is provided to run some of the services for local development. The services include:

- PgBouncer
- Valkey
- LDAP

Head to the `dev` folder in the repository and run the following command:

::Codeblock

```bash
cd dev
docker-compose up
```

::
To stop the services, use the following command:

::Codeblock

```bash
docker-compose down
```

::

::banner{type="hint"}
It is generally recommended to not use Valkey for local development, as the caching mechanisms of xbat can lead to unpredictable behaviour during certain operations. You only need PgBouncer for local development which you can run with `docker-compose up pgbouncer`.

::

## LDAP

::

To use LDAP for local development, modify the `[authentication]` section of your `xbat.conf`:

::Codeblock

```ini
[ldap]
provider = ldap
address = ldap://localhost:389
basedn = ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
```

::

::Banner{type="info"}
You need to manually add users to the LDAP server when starting the docker-compose environment. Users are currently not persisted.
::

Execute the provided `ldap_setup.sh` script to set up the LDAP server:

::Codeblock

```bash
docker exec xbat-ldap /bin/bash -c /ldap_setup.sh
```

::
Afterwards, you can log in with the user `johndoe` and password `password`.
