## Docker Compose Environment

::

For convenience, a Docker Compose environment is provided to run some of the services for local development. The services include:

-   PgBouncer
-   Valkey
-   LDAP

Head to the `dev` folder in the repository and run the following command:

::Codeblock

```bash
cd dev
docker-compose up
```

::
To stop the services, use the following command:

::Codeblock

```bash
docker-compose down
```

::

::Headline

## LDAP

::

To use LDAP for local development, modify the `[authentication]` section of your `xbat.conf`:

::Codeblock

```ini
[ldap]
provider = ldap
address = ldap://localhost:389
basedn = ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
```

::

::Banner{type="info"}
You need to manually add users to the LDAP server when starting the docker-compose environment. Users are currently not persisted.
::

Execute the provided `ldap_setup.sh` script to set up the LDAP server:

::Codeblock

```bash
docker exec xbat-ldap /bin/bash -c /ldap_setup.sh
```

::
Afterwards, you can log in with the user `johndoe` and password `password`.
