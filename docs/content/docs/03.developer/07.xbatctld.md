The proto file can be found at `src/shared/grpc/xbat.proto`. During the initial setup of the Python packages, the gRPC code is generated automatically. When making changes to the proto file, the code must be regenerated with the command below:

::codeblock

```bash
cd src
python3 setup.py build_proto
```

The gRPC server is available at Port `50051`.
