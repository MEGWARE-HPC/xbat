## Prerequisites

::

::Banner{type=warning}
Currently, local development of xbat is only possible if you already have a running (remote) xbat instance that you can connect to. This will be changed in the future.
::

Development was only tested on Linux, any distribution should suffice. Please ensure you have the following installed:

-   Git
-   Python (v3.12 or later)
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)([-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)) or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation#installing-on-linux)([-compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose?tab=readme-ov-file#installation))
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v16.0 or later)
-   [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Setup

::

Create the configuration folder with the following command:

::Codeblock

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/xbat
```

::

Copy all configuration files into this folder. The configuration files are located in the `config` folder of the repository.

::Codeblock

```bash
sudo cp conf/xbat.conf conf/valkey.conf /etc/xbat
sudo cp conf/pgbouncer.ini.in /etc/xbat/pgbouncer.ini
```

::

Modify `/etc/xbat/xbat.conf` to connect to your remote xbat instance. Changes are only required for the `[mongodb]` and `[questdb]` sections.

Since PgBouncer is used to connect to QuestDB, changes are required in the `/etc/xbat/pgbouncer.ini` file. Modify the `[databases]` section to match your QuestDB configuration. Afterwards, create a userlist file with the command below. The `user` and `password` must match the credentials in the `[pgbouncer]` section of the `/etc/xbat/xbat.conf` file.:

::Codeblock

```bash
echo echo '"<user>" "<password>"' | sudo tee /etc/xbat/userlists.txt > /dev/null
```

::

### Permissions and Ownership

::

Analogous to the production deployment, a local user called `xbat` is required. Create this user with the command below. Due to the `--system` parameter, the user will not have a home directory and will be used for system purposes only. Additionally, the shell is set to `/bin/false`, which means this user cannot log in interactively.

::Codeblock

```bash
sudo useradd --system --shell /bin/false xbat
```

::

::Codeblock

```bash
sudo chown -R xbat:xbat /etc/xbat && sudo chmod 755 -R /etc/xbat
```
