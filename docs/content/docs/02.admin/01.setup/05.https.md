## Certificate Setup

::

Encryption via HTTPS is automatically provided by [nginx](https://nginx.org/) within the `xbat.service`. The certificates must be created manually and placed in `/etc/xbat/certs/`. By default certificates are expected to be placed in `/etc/xbat/certs`. If you want to use a different directory, you can specify it with the `--certificate-dir` option during the installation of xbat.

Use an existing certificate or check out this [guide](https://linuxize.com/post/creating-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate/) for generating a new one. For testing purposes the development certificates can be used. They are located in the `dev/certs` directory of the xbat repository.

::banner{type="hint"}
Certificates are automatically detected as long as they match this naming scheme: `[cert|fullchain].[crt|pem]` and `[key|privkey].[key|prem]`.
::

After placing these files, adjust the ownership and permissions to make sure nginx (the `xbat` user) has access and restart the service afterwards.

```bash
chown -R xbat:xbat /etc/xbat/certs
chmod -R 750 /etc/xbat/certs/
```
