## Slurm Configuration

::

Changes to the Slurm configuration (usually located at `/etc/slurm/slurm.conf`) are required to facilitate the measurements. Since the [xbatd](/docs/admin/setup/xbatd) is only running for the duration of the job, it is started and stopped via [Slurms Prolog and Epilog](https://slurm.schedmd.com/prolog_epilog.html) scripts for each job.

### Prolog, Epilog and Feature Flags

::

Copy `scripts/prolog.sh` and `scripts/epilog.sh` to a secure location on your cluster where all compute nodes but not regular users have access to. Edit `slurm.conf` accordingly:

::codeblock

```bash
Prolog=/path/to/prolog.sh
Epilog=/path/to/epilog.sh

# or specify directory when using multiple scripts
Prolog=/path/to/prolog.d/*
Epilog=/path/to/epilog.d/*
```

::

Both scripts are configured to only run when the job specifies the `xbat` constraint (`--constraint xbat`). All nodes that are intended to be used with xbat require this feature flag. See [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html#OPT_Features) for further details.

::codeblock

```bash
Features=xbat
```
