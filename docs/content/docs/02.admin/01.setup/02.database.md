description: Initial setup of the xbat databases
---

xbat uses MongoDB for storing user, job and configuration data while QuestDB is used for time-series data. The `xbat.service` must be running in order to access the databases for initial configuration.

::Headline

## MongoDB

::

The Mongo database is hosted within the docker infrastructure (`xbat-mongodb`). Data is persistently stored at `/var/lib/xbat/mongodb/` on the host and then mounted into the container. The corresponding `mongod.conf` is created on installation at `/etc/xbat/` and does not require further modification.

Attach to xbat-mongodb container to start the configuration:

::codeblock

```bash
podman exec -it xbat-mongodb /bin/bash
```

::

::headline

### Authentication

::

Follow the steps below to create the necessary accounts for authentication. All accounts for authentication must be created in database `admin`

::codeblock

```bash
mongo
use admin
```

::

Create an `admin` account to manage MongoDB. This account is different from the `admin` account used to access xbat.

<!-- TODO find better code highlighting language for mongo shell -->

::codeblock

```javascript
db.createUser({
    user: "admin",
    pwd: passwordPrompt(),
    roles: [
        { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" },
        "readWriteAnyDatabase"
    ]
});
```

::

Exit mongo with `CTRL+D`. From now on access to MongoDB requires authentication. Exit the mongo tool and log back in with
::codeblock

```bash
mongo --authenticationDatabase=admin --username admin
```

::

Afterwards add a user called `xbat`. These credentials will be used by the xbat services to access the database and must be entered in the `/etc/xbat/xbat.conf` file under the `[mongodb]` section (`user` and `password`).

::codeblock

```javascript
use admin
db.createUser(
    {
     user: "xbat",
     pwd: passwordPrompt(),
     roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "xbat" }]
    }
)
```

### OAuth Configuration

::
Authentication of all users is handled by OAuth and requires creating the `admin` user and client on initial setup. Switch to the `xbat` database with the following command:

::codeblock

```plaintext
use xbat
```

::

Create the xbat `admin` account. The default password is `admin` and can be changed via the user interface. All other users will be imported from the User Management System upon their first login.

::codeblock

```javascript
db.users.insert({
    user_name: "admin",
    user_type: "admin",
    password: "*4ACFE3202A5FF5CF467898FC58AAB1D615029441"
});
```

::

Create the frontend and swagger clients for admin. All other user clients will be created automatically.

::codeblock

```javascript
db.clients.insert({
    name: "admin",
    client_id: "wf_admin",
    redirect_uris: "",
    default_scopes:
        "benchmarks_r benchmarks_w configurations_r configurations_w projects_r projects_w settings_r settings_w users_r users_w user_self_r user_self_w benchmarks_dr benchmarks_dw"
});

db.clients.insert({
    name: "admin",
    client_id: "admin",
    redirect_uris:
        "https://localhost:7000/api/v1/ui/oauth2-redirect.html https://127.0.0.1:7000/api/v1/ui/oauth2-redirect.html",
    default_scopes:
        "benchmarks_r benchmarks_w configurations_r configurations_w projects_r projects_w settings_r settings_w users_r users_w user_self_r user_self_w benchmarks_dr benchmarks_dw"
});
```

::

The xbat daemon (`xbatd`) also authenticates with the backend via the REST-API. Create a client for `xbatd` by generating a client secret (typically a random string with length between 32 and 64).

::codeblock

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

::

Insert the xbatd client into the database.

::codeblock

```javascript
db.clients.insert({
    name: "xbatd",
    client_id: "xbatd",
    client_secret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
    redirect_uris: "",
    default_scopes: "benchmarks_dr benchmarks_dw"
});
```

::

Exit the mongo shell with `CTRL+D` and set the credentials of the xbat user in the `/etc/xbat/xbat.conf` file under the `[mongodb]` section.

::headline

## QuestDB

::

QuestDB is hosted within the docker infrastructure (`xbat-questdb`). Data is persistently stored at `/var/lib/xbat/questdb/` on the host and then mounted into the container. The corresponding `questdb-log.conf` and `questdb.conf` are created on installation at `/etc/xbat/`. The latter requires to set `user` and `password` for the PGWire and HTTP interface.

::codeblock

```bash
# for backend
pg.password=<password>
pg.user=<user>

# for xbatd
http.user=<user>
http.password=<password>
```

::

Afterwards set the credentials at `/etc/xbat/xbat.conf` for `[questdb]` accordingly. The `user` and `password` are equivalent to `pg.user` and `pg.password` in the `questdb.conf`. Credentials for `api_user` and `api_password` must match `http.user` and `http.password`.

::headline

### System Configuration

::

QuestDB and Valkey require adjusting sysctl settings to prevent unpredictable behaviour and out-of-memory exceptions (see [here](https://questdb.io/docs/deployment/capacity-planning/#os-configuration){:target="_blank"}).

Modify `/etc/sysctl.conf` to change limits.

::codeblock

```bash
# add/set open file limit (QuestDB)
fs.file-max=1048576

# add/set max virtual memory areas limit (QuestDB)
vm.max_map_count=1048576

# enable memory overcommitment (Valkey)
vm.overcommit_memory=1
```

::

Afterwards apply the changes with `sysctl -p`.
