## Daemon (xbatd)

::

xbatd is a service that collects performance metrics during job runtime and writes them to the time-series database. The service is only running for the duration of the job and is started and stopped automatically. The daemon expects a configuration file at `/etc/xbatd/xbatd.conf` which contains credentials and settings. The template can be found at `conf/xbatd.conf`. This file must be present on all nodes and be secured against access from regular users. Apply all credentials configured in the [database setup](/docs/admin/setup/database).

### Building the xbatd RPM

::

Use the provided script to build the daemon in a docker container without worrying about any dependencies. Version number and distro are required parameters, only RHEL8 and RHEL9 are currently supported. The RPM will be copied to current directory and must be installed on all compute nodes.

```bash
cd src/xbatd
./build.sh <version> [--distro (el8|el9)] [--release <release>] [--executor (docker|podman)] [--help]
```
