## General Settings

::

Job configurations are powerful wrappers around your jobscript that provide you with extended control over your job as well as features like parameter substitution.

Visit the `CONFIGURATIONS` tab and click `NEW CONFIGURATION` to create an empty configuration. As your first step, a few general options must be specified:

-   **Configuration Name**: The name of the configuration (not the job).
-   **Iterations**: Specifies how often your job should be executed when submitting this configuration. This is helpful for running a job multiple times for statistical analysis.
-   **Share with Project**: Select projects that should have access to this configuration. See [Projects](/docs/user/projects) for more information.
-   **Measurement Interval**: Interval at which the job is monitored in seconds. The current minimum is 5 seconds.
-   **Enable general monitoring**: Enables/disables monitoring for the configuration
-   **Enable monitoring hardware performance counters**: Enables/disables monitoring via hardware performance counters for low level metrics.

Make sure shared configurations do not contain sensitive information like passwords or API keys.

Shared configurations only work with user-independent settings - other users do not have access to your home directory or environment variables.
::

Each configuration is assigned a unique ID that can be used to submit jobs via the [API](/docs/user/api) as part of a [Continuous Integration setup](/docs/user/ci).

## Job Script

::

Job scripts in xbat are similar to your regular Slurm job script. The most important `#SBATCH` directives are fixed at the top of your jobscript and cannot be removed. No values are required for `--job-name` and `--nodelist` - a job name will be autogenerated if none is given and the nodelist is determined by the scheduler. You may add your own Slurm directives below them - check the [Slurm Documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#SECTION_OPTIONS){:target="_blank"} for more information. Details about the partitions and nodes of your cluster can be viewed by clicking the `PARTITIONS & NODES` button above the job script editor.

Jobs are launched as the respective user and therefore have access to its home directory and environment variables.

## Variants

::

Job variants allow you to run different version of the same job script with different parameters. Variants can be added by clicking the `ADD VARIANT` button which will create a copy of the currently selected variant. You can define custom names for each variant for better identification.

## Variables

::

You can define job variables by clicking the `Job Variables` button above the job script editor. They will be provided to your job as environment variables. Variables can be used in the job script by using the syntax `$VARIABLE`. Variables can have a single or multiple values. If multiple values are provided, a job will be created for each value.
