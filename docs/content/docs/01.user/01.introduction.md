## xbat

::

xbat (e**x**tended **b**enchmarking **a**utomation **t**ool) is a continuous benchmarking solution for High Performance Computing (HPC) environments, developed by [MEGWARE](https://megware.com/){:target="_blank"}. Designed to simplify the benchmarking process for both experienced and inexperienced users, xbat provides a fully automated, intuitive interface to configure, run, and evaluate application performance without requiring extensive setup or hardware expertise.

The tool consolidates all aspects of the benchmarking workflow into a single, easily accessible web-based application. It gathers in-depth performance metrics, leveraging the LIKWID performance tool and other system libraries, allowing users to easily assess their applications across a wide range of hardware parameters. This capability makes xbat especially valuable for optimizing runtime and energy costs, regardless of the specific research or computational field.
