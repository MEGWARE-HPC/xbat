## What xbat collects

::

Around 140 different metrics are collected from various sources. These include:

| Metric Type  | Source                                                                                                                           | Limitation                  |

| Energy       | [LIKWID](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid){:target="_blank"}, IPMI                                                                               |                             |
| GPU          | [nvml](https://developer.nvidia.com/management-library-nvml){:target="_blank"} and [amd-smi](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/amdsmi/en/latest/){:target="_blank"} |                             |
| FPGAS        | `/sys/bus/pci/devices/`                                                                                                          | Xilinx only                 |
| I/O          | [iostat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/iostat){:target="_blank"}                                                                                     |                             |
| Interconnect | `/proc/net/dev` and `/sys/class/infiniband`                                                                                      | Ethernet and Infiniband only |

All metrics are gathered at their finest possible resolution, which means that many metrics are available at `thread` level. This allows us to aggregate them upwards and provide these metrics not only at `thread`, but also at `core`, `numa`, `socket`, `node` and `job` level

## Sampling Frequency

::

The currently lowest possible frequency for measurements is 5 seconds. Users can manually set the sampling frequency to a higher value, which may be sensible for longer running jobs.

::Headline

## Overhead

::

When benchmarking your application with xbat an overhead of **less than one percent** is expected (with 5 second sampling frequency). This overhead was determined by comparing standalone runs of [HPL](https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/){:target="_blank"} with runs using xbat.

::Headline

## Caveats

::

Many metrics are gathered using Hardware Performance Monitoring via [LIKWID](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid){:target="_blank"} and are therefore relying on the hardware counters and events that the CPU provides. Due to differences between vendors and even CPU generations, not all metrics will be available on every system.
