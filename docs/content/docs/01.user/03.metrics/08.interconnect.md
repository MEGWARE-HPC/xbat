## Ethernet Bandwidth

::

Ethernet bandwidth measures the rate of data transfer over the network interface, capturing both receive and transmit operations.

| Metric \[e.g. GByte/s\] | Description                                          |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| receive                 | Rate of data received over the Ethernet interface    |
| transmit                | Rate of data transmitted over the Ethernet interface |

The Ethernet bandwidth provide insights into the network activity of the system. High bandwidth usage in receive or transmit directions may indicate heavy network traffic, which could impact system or application performance. Monitoring Ethernet bandwidth helps identify network bottlenecks and optimize data transfer efficiency.

## Ethernet Packages

::

Ethernet packages measure the number of network packets transferred over the Ethernet interface, including both received and transmitted packets.

| Metric \[packets/s\] | Description                                               |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| receive              | Number of packets received over the Ethernet interface    |
| transmit             | Number of packets transmitted over the Ethernet interface |

These metrics help analyze the packet-level activity of the network interface. High values for received or transmitted packets indicate significant network communication, which could impact latency or throughput.

## Infiniband Bandwidth

::

Infiniband bandwidth measures the rate of data transfer over the Infiniband interconnect, capturing both receive and transmit operations.

| Metric \[e.g. GByte/s\] | Description                                            |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| receive                 | Rate of data received over the Infiniband interface    |
| transmit                | Rate of data transmitted over the Infiniband interface |

These metrics provide insights into the performance of the Infiniband interconnect. High bandwidth usage may indicate heavy inter-node communication.
