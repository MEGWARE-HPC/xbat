## Bandwidth

::

Memory bandwidth measures the rate at which data is transferred between the main memory (DRAM) and the CPU. This includes read, write, load, and eviction operations, and provides a detailed view of how efficiently the memory subsystem is utilized. It is a critical metric for identifying potential bottlenecks in memory-intensive applications.

| Metric \[e.g. GByte/s\] | Description                                                                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| total                   | Overall data transfer rate between the CPU and main memory, combining all read, write, load, and eviction operations |
| read                    | Rate of data read from main memory                                                                                   |
| write                   | Rate of data written to main memory                                                                                  |

High utilization of total bandwidth, particularly in read or write operations, may indicate that the workload is memory-bound rather than compute-bound. While maximizing bandwidth is desirable, inefficiencies like excessive evictions or poor data reuse can still hinder performance. Optimizing memory access patterns, reducing unnecessary data transfers, and improving cache utilization can help ensure effective use of available memory bandwidth.

High data volume indicates workloads with significant memory demands, which may lead to memory bottlenecks if the systemâ€™s bandwidth is insufficient. However, high memory data volume is not inherently inefficient. Effective memory utilization depends on workload characteristics, data locality, and reuse. Reducing unnecessary memory transfers and optimizing data access patterns can help mitigate performance issues in memory-bound applications. This metric, in conjunction with bandwidth and cache performance, provides a comprehensive understanding of memory subsystem behavior.
