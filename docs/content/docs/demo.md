## Microcard Mirror Instance

::

xbat is actively used within the EuroHPC project [Microcard](https://www.microcard.eu/) and the [openCARP](https://opencarp.org/) software as a part of their [CI infrastructure](https://git.opencarp.org/openCARP/openCARP/-/blob/master/.gitlab/ci/xbat.gitlab-ci.yml). Every code change triggers a benchmark within the MEGWARE infrastructure, which is then mirrored to the public Microcard instance. You can access this mirror instance [here](https://microcard.xbat.dev).
