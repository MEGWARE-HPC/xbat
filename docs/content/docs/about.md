## What is xbat?

::

xbat (e**x**tended **b**enchmarking **a**utomation **t**ool) is an intuitive, web-based solution for benchmarking user applications in High Performance Computing environments. It streamlines the entire benchmarking workflow and delivers in-depth performance metrics to help optimize resource usage and energy efficiency, making it valuable for both novice and expert users across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications.

The tool was developed by Nico Tippmann at [MEGWARE Computer Vertrieb und Service GmbH](https://www.megware.com/) and is freely available under the MIT License on [GitHub](https://github.com/MEGWARE-HPC/xbat).
